# Wotan Stellar Database

A database of stars, planets, moons, and other celestial bodies modeled after the real
Milky Way Galaxy. This is intended to be a resource for world-building and storytelling for
a science fiction game, and also as a sandbox for playing around with spatial queries, pathfinding,
procedural generation, and other fun topics.

# Technology

* .NET 10 and C#
* PostgreSQL and PostGIS for spatial queries
* EF Core for data access

# Credits

This uses [stellar data](http://evildrganymede.net/wp/rpgs/stellar-mapping/) to give a starting
point for world-building in the galaxy - roughly 200 LY around Sol. See [Galactic readme.txt](Galactic%20readme.txt)
for more details on the data.
